CI/CD Pipelines: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying code. Continuous Integration
(CI) merges and tests code changes, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates releases to production.
Importance: They streamline development, catch errors early, and ensure fast, reliable deployment of 
features like user management and booking systems, enhancing scalability and collaboration.
Tools: GitHub Actions (automates workflows), Docker (ensures consistent environments), Jenkins 
(orchestrates pipelines), CircleCI (fast CI/CD integration).
